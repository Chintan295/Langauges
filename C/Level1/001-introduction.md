# Introduction

### What is C?
C is a high-level, general-purpose programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie between 1969 and 1973. It's a powerful, efficient, and flexible language that's still widely used today.

### Features of C:
* Portability: C code can run on various platforms with minimal modifications.
* Efficiency: C code is typically fast and optimized.
* Flexibility: C can be used for a wide range of applications, from systems programming to embedded systems.
* Low-level access: C provides direct access to hardware resources.
* Middle-Level Language: As it is a middle-level language so it has the combined form of both capabilities of assembly language and features of the high-level language.


### History of C:
* Developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs
* Initially called "New B" (based on BCPL and B languages) Renamed to C in 1972
* Standardized as ANSI C in 1989 (C89)
* Updated standards: C99, C11, C17, and C23

### Why learn C?
Foundational language: C is the basis for many other languages (C++, Java, Python, etc.)
System programming: C is essential for systems programming, embedded systems, and operating systems
Performance: C code is often faster and more efficient than other languages
Career opportunities: Knowledge of C is a valuable skill in the job market

### Difference b/w C and C++
* C++ supports OOPs paradigm while C only have procedural concept of programming.
* C++ have exception handling capablities. In C, we have to resolve manually.
* There are no references in C.
